Distributing

- Register your stuff on the container with
  an application initializer               

- Precompile templates individually as the 
  `layout` property of the component       

- Use `ic-styled` for the minimum viable   
  amount of css for the component to work  

- Use broccoli-dist-es6-module and publish 
  to your favorite package managers
